# image-download

## Instructions
Run `npm i` to install dependencies
Add URL's of all images you want to download to the array in the data.js file
Run `node index.js` to download images.

### Stuff
For some reason if error's aren't caught and the script stops, you can use the `find()` function (currently commented out on index.js) to find the index of the previous URL so you can restart the script from there instead of from the beginning.
